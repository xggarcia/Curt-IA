## THE MARGIN NOTE (Revised)

**LOGLINE:** A perfectionist proofreader finds a single, unauthorized word scrawled in the margin of a manuscript, shattering his meticulous world.

**SCENE 1**

**INT. ARCHIVE OFFICE - NIGHT**

SOUND of the soft, rhythmic CLICK of a mechanical keyboard.

The room is sterile, lit by the cold, focused glow of a single DESK LAMP.

ARTHUR (50s), immaculate, sits before a massive, bound MANUSCRIPT. His posture is rigid.

CLOSE ON: Arthur’s hand, gripping a sharp, bright RED PEN. He traces a line of dense academic text. Perfection.

He moves down the page. He reaches the bottom corner.

CLOSE ON: The margin. A single, jarringly messy, black ink word is scrawled there.

The word: **"WHY?"**

Arthur freezes. The keyboard CLICK STOPS. Silence.

His gaze snaps to the preceding line—dry, historical prose.

Arthur lifts the red pen, hovering just above the offending mark. He cannot touch it.

He leans in, face inches from the paper, staring at the defiant question.

Arthur deliberately places the red pen down.

He reaches into his breast pocket and extracts a slender, silver FOUNTAIN PEN.

He uncaps it.

CLOSE ON: Arthur’s hand, moving with agonizing slowness.

Instead of striking out the question, he writes one word directly beneath it, in elegant script.

**ARTHUR (V.O.)**
(A breathy whisper)
Because.

Arthur leans back. The rigidity leaves his frame. A profound, unsettling calm washes over his features. A faint, almost imperceptible SMILE.

He reaches out and gently closes the heavy manuscript. The sound is a soft, final THUD.

**FADE TO BLACK.**
