Since no specific feedback was provided beyond the initial concept ("A cat trying to eat a fish"), the revision will focus on maximizing visual impact, establishing a clear, concise emotional arc (desire, near success, failure/resignation), and ensuring it fits the target duration of approximately 180 seconds (3 minutes) through focused, deliberate pacing.

## THE CATCH

**LOGLINE:** A determined house cat attempts a daring heist to secure a prized fish, only to face the stark reality of the kitchen barrier.

**SCENE COUNT:** 2

**TOTAL PAGES:** ~2.5

**FADE IN:**

**INT. KITCHEN - DAY**

Sunlight streams through a window, illuminating dust motes dancing above a pristine, granite countertop.

SOUND of distant, slow ticking clock

CLOSE ON: A magnificent, whole SALMON, glistening and perfectly arranged on a large, silver platter. It looks like a trophy.

WIDER: A scruffy, yet noble-looking TABBY CAT, LEO (5), sits low to the ground, perfectly still, six feet from the counter. His eyes are locked on the fish—pure, predatory focus.

Leo twitches his tail once.

**ACTION**
Leo executes a slow, silent approach, belly low to the tiled floor. He moves with the grace of a seasoned burglar.

He reaches the base of the kitchen island. He pauses, assessing the vertical climb.

**CLOSE ON LEO'S FACE**
A bead of saliva forms at the corner of his mouth.

He leaps.

It’s a powerful, slightly clumsy jump. His front paws scrabble against the cabinet door below the counter, missing the grip.

He slides back down, landing silently on the floor. He doesn't flinch. He just resets his posture.

**SECOND ATTEMPT**
Leo finds a small, overturned FRUIT BOWL near the pantry. He nudges it with his nose, positioning it against the cabinet.

He climbs onto the bowl, using the slight elevation to gain purchase on the cabinet edge. He scrambles, claws finding purchase.

He pulls himself onto the countertop, a moment of sheer triumph in his eyes.

**INT. KITCHEN COUNTERTOP - CONTINUOUS**

Leo is now on the high ground. He stalks toward the platter. The salmon seems impossibly large up close.

He sniffs the air, inhaling the rich, oily scent.

He gently paws the tail fin. It slides slightly on the platter.

He opens his jaws wide, preparing for the glorious first bite.

**CLOSE ON LEO'S MOUTH**
Just as he lowers his head—

**SOUND**
A sudden, sharp **BEEP**.

Leo freezes, mid-lunge.

**WIDER**
A small, digital KITCHEN TIMER on the far side of the counter flashes "00:00."

Leo slowly raises his head, looking around, confused by the noise.

He turns back to the fish, ready to resume his feast.

**SOUND**
A loud, heavy **CLUNK** from the adjacent dining room.

Leo’s ears flatten. He knows that sound.

**INT. DINING ROOM DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS**

The doorway to the dining room is visible from the counter.

A pair of large, worn LEATHER SLIPPERS enters the frame, followed by the slow, deliberate footsteps of OWNER (O.S.).

Leo’s focus snaps from the fish to the doorway. Panic flickers in his eyes.

He has seconds.

He lunges for the salmon, grabbing the very edge of the tail in his teeth.

**ACTION**
He pulls. The fish is too heavy, too anchored to the platter.

The Owner’s shadow stretches across the kitchen floor.

Leo gives one final, desperate yank.

**SOUND**
A high-pitched, strained **MEOW** of frustration.

He loses his grip.

The Owner’s slippers stop just outside the kitchen threshold.

Leo, defeated, abandons the fish. He executes a perfect, panicked dive off the counter edge, landing awkwardly but quickly scrambling away from the scene of the crime.

**INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER**

The Owner (unseen, implied presence) is now near the counter.

Leo is tucked tightly under the kitchen table, peering out. He is breathing hard.

We focus on the salmon, still untouched on the platter.

The Owner’s hand enters the frame, picks up the platter, and moves it away.

**CLOSE ON LEO**
His eyes follow the departing fish. The predatory focus is gone, replaced by profound, weary disappointment.

He lets out a small, sad sigh—a puff of air that barely moves the dust under the table.

He closes his eyes, accepting the loss.

**FADE TO BLACK.**
