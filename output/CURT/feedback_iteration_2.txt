AGGREGATED FEEDBACK:
=== TRIBUNAL VOTING RESULTS ===

STATUS: ✗ REJECTED

✓ [TechnicalCritic] Score: 9.0/10
   Comments: ✅ GOOD:
  • **Visual Clarity and Focus:** The script relies heavily on tight close-ups (Typewriter, Paper, Martha's face) which are excellent for controlled, focused visual storytelling, highly feasible for high-quality rendering or filming.
  • **Sound Design Simplicity:** The primary sound elements (RAIN, TYPING, DING) are straightforward and atmospheric, requiring minimal complex sound mixing or Foley work beyond establishing the mood.
  • **Minimal Set Requirements:** The entire scene takes place in a single, contained location (Dusty Office), which significantly reduces logistical complexity and cost.

❌ BAD:
  • **The "Draft Ball" Throw:** While emotionally resonant, the action of Martha hurling a "crumpled DRAFT BALL" across the room and having it hit a bookshelf with a "soft thud" requires careful staging. If this is intended for AI generation, ensuring the physics of the throw and the resulting bounce look natural, rather than floaty or overly dramatic, could be a minor challenge.
  • **Lighting Contrast Control:** The description relies on a "harsh desk lamp" contrasting with the "dark window." Maintaining this specific, high-contrast chiaroscuro effect consistently across all close-ups without blowing out highlights or losing detail in the shadows requires precise lighting control, which translates to careful rendering parameters.

✗ [NarrativeCritic] Score: 8.0/10
   Comments: ✅ GOOD:
  • **Visual Economy:** The script utilizes the single page effectively, relying almost entirely on visual action (typing, throwing the draft, close-ups) to convey the internal struggle, which is excellent for a short film format.
  • **Thematic Punch:** The final line, "He was already inside," delivers a sharp, unexpected twist that recontextualizes the preceding lines immediately, creating a powerful moment of dread.
  • **Atmosphere Setting:** The initial description ("Dusty Office," "harsh desk lamp," "rhythmic RAIN") efficiently establishes a claustrophobic, noir-ish tone suitable for a suspenseful reveal.

❌ BAD:
  • **Lack of Contextual Stakes:** While the *result* is horrifying, the *reason* Martha is struggling to write this specific sentence is entirely internal and unstated. The audience doesn't know if this is fiction, a confession, or a memory, which slightly dampens the immediate emotional connection to her struggle.
  • **Dialogue Over-Explanation:** The line, "Finished. Just one more," is slightly on-the-nose. For a character this deep into a creative struggle, the action of staring at the page should convey the need for the final line, making the dialogue redundant.
  • **Pacing of Frustration:** The sequence of sipping water, slamming the glass, and throwing the draft feels slightly rushed for a character who has been staring defeatedly moments before. The transition from defeat to violence needs a slightly clearer emotional bridge.
   Suggestions:
   1. **Refine Martha's Opening Line:** Replace or remove Martha's opening dialogue. Instead of saying "Finished. Just one more," use a visual cue. Perhaps she types the first three lines, then stares at the carriage return lever, her hand hovering over it, conveying the need for the final beat without speaking.
   2. **Enhance the Reveal's Buildup:** Before the final typing flurry, add a beat where Martha looks directly at the *door* or the *window* (the source of her expected sound). This visually links her expectation (the key) to the final, terrifying reality (he is inside, bypassing the lock).
   3. **Sharpen the Final Reaction:** The reaction ("relief immediate, but quickly curdling into a silent, deep-seated HORROR") is good, but needs a stronger physical manifestation than just trembling lips. Suggest: After tracing the word "inside," Martha’s eyes snap up to the *door* again, but this time, she doesn't just look—she flinches, perhaps pulling her hands back from the keys as if burned, before resting her forehead against the machine in resignation/terror.

✗ [AudienceCritic] Score: 7.0/10
   Comments: ✅ GOOD:
  • The opening visual of the dusty office and the vintage typewriter immediately sets a mood. It feels atmospheric and classic, which is engaging.
  • The build-up of frustration, especially when she throws the crumpled draft ball, is a good visual representation of writer's block, making Martha relatable.
  • The final line, "He was already inside," is a fantastic punchline/twist. It delivers a sudden jolt of horror that works well for a short piece.

❌ BAD:
  • Since it’s only one page, the story moves very fast, which is fine, but I needed a tiny bit more context for *why* she was waiting for his key. Is he missing? Is he dangerous? The script relies entirely on the audience filling in the blanks, which might leave some viewers feeling unsatisfied.
  • The transition from defeated silence to "flurry of rapid, determined TYPING" felt a bit abrupt. We see her sip water, slam the glass down, throw a ball, and then *BAM*, she's writing furiously. A small beat showing the *idea* hitting her might help bridge that gap.
  • The ending, while scary, is very static. She traces the word and then just rests her head on the typewriter. For a moment of supposed horror, it feels a little too quiet and internal.
   Suggestions:
   1. When Martha slams the glass down, add a very quick, almost subliminal visual flash—maybe a quick shot of a shadow moving outside the window or a reflection in the glass that she *almost* catches—just before she slams her hands on the keys. This justifies the sudden burst of inspiration/panic that leads to the final line.
   2. To heighten the horror at the end, instead of just tracing the word, have her physically recoil slightly from the typewriter when she reads "inside." Make the physical reaction bigger than just trembling—maybe she pulls her hand back as if the paper burned her.
   3. Since the genre seems to be psychological thriller/horror, let's use the sound design more. When she finishes typing, instead of just the steady rain, maybe the sound of the rain momentarily cuts out or distorts right after she reads the final line, emphasizing the shift in her reality.
