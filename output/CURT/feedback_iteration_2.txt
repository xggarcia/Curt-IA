=== TRIBUNAL VOTING RESULTS ===

STATUS: ✗ REJECTED

✗ [TechnicalCritic] Score: 7.0/10
   Comments: ✅ GOOD:
  • **Visual Clarity and Concept:** The script clearly defines the aesthetic contrast required: "algorithmic perfection" versus "digital seams fraying." This provides strong direction for visual effects teams regarding texture, lighting, and movement synchronization.
  • **Pacing for Short Form:** The scene breakdowns are tight and move quickly, fitting the 3-minute target duration well. The escalation from subtle shifts (music change) to overt failure (cracking environment) is well-paced for a short film.
  • **Use of Subtle Effects:** The initial effects—the synchronized pedestrians, the pulsing geometric shapes, and the Counselor's momentary seizure—are achievable with standard motion graphics and compositing, providing strong early visual hooks without immediate reliance on massive CG builds.

❌ BAD:
  • **Complexity of the Final Reveal:** The final sequence (2:40 onwards) requires extremely high-level, complex VFX work. Revealing "raw, chaotic code beneath the surface" while the environment fragments violently is technically demanding and risks looking cheap or unconvincing if not executed perfectly, especially within a short runtime budget.
  • **Holographic Elements:** The "floating, softly glowing GEOMETRIC SHAPES" and the "holographic projection" of the sculpture require consistent, high-quality volumetric rendering or advanced compositing to maintain the illusion of three-dimensionality and interaction with the environment/actors. Poor execution here will immediately break the world-building.
  • **The Tattoo Glitch:** The description of the tattoo breaking into "tiny, disconnected, floating cubes" (2:25-2:40) is a very specific, high-fidelity texture/geometry manipulation that must be perfectly timed with the actor's movement and the subsequent facial distortion. This is a high-risk, high-reward effect.
   Suggestions:
   1. **Refine the Counselor Seizure:** Specify the nature of the seizure at (1:30). Instead of just "snapping back," consider: "Its fingers extend, but the joints lock into impossible, sharp angles for a beat, before the model rapidly smooths itself back into fluid motion." This gives the VFX artist a clearer target for the digital error.
   2. **Simplify the Final Breakdown:** To ensure budget feasibility while maintaining impact, refine the final breakdown (2:50). Instead of *all* geometry fragmenting, focus the failure on a single, large surface, such as the floor or the wall behind Vega, cracking like shattered glass to reveal a dark, code-filled void underneath. This focuses the complexity.
   3. **Clarify Lighting for Doubt:** At (1:15), when Vega feels the light is too bright, add a specific lighting cue for the DP/VFX team: "The ambient light in the studio shifts from soft white to a harsh, over-exposed clinical white, emphasizing every pore and imperfection on Vega's skin." This reinforces the theme visually without heavy CG.

✗ [NarrativeCritic] Score: 8.0/10
   Comments: ✅ GOOD:
  • **Strong Visual Metaphor:** The concept of the "digital seams fraying" is executed excellently through the visual cues (the Counselor's seizure, the sculpture snapping back, the final environment fragmentation). This effectively externalizes Vega's internal crisis.
  • **Efficient World-Building:** Within the first 35 seconds, the script establishes the tone, the setting (futuristic perfection), and the antagonist (Oraculum) through V.O. and visual description, which is crucial for a 3-minute short.
  • **Clear Escalation of Conflict:** The conflict moves logically from external control (music change) to direct physical resistance (stylus input) to existential realization (the reflection/tattoo glitch), building tension effectively toward the climax.

❌ BAD:
  • **Underdeveloped Character Motivation:** While Vega’s desire for asymmetry is stated, the *why* behind her deep need to break free isn't fully established in the short runtime. Her compliance at the start feels too practiced, making her sudden rebellion slightly less earned.
  • **Dialogue is Overly Thematic:** The dialogue, particularly Vega’s V.O. lines ("Do I really like this kind of music, or is it just what the system has dictated I should like?"), is very direct in stating the theme rather than letting the action convey it.
  • **The Counselor is Underutilized:** The Counselor serves as a good immediate foil, but its brief seizure (the finger freeze) is a strong beat that isn't followed up on, leaving a potentially powerful visual moment underdeveloped.
   Suggestions:
   1. **Sharpen Vega's Initial State:** In Act I, show a *micro-moment* of Vega successfully creating something "perfect" that she immediately dislikes, before she voices her desire for asymmetry. This grounds her rebellion in a specific failure, rather than just a general philosophical desire.
   2. **Integrate the Counselor Glitch:** When the Counselor’s fingers seize up (1:20-1:40), have Vega react with more than just confrontation. Perhaps she tries to touch the glitching hand, or the Counselor immediately smooths over the moment with an overly cheerful, slightly manic reassurance, making the AI seem more unstable/aware of its own flaws.
   3. **Refine Vega's Final Line:** The final V.O. line ("Am I creating this, or is the system creating me?") is too on-the-nose. Replace it with a more visceral, personal reaction to seeing her tattoo vanish. For example: "Where did *I* go?" or simply a sharp, breathy sound of realization, letting the visual of the blank skin speak for itself.

✗ [AudienceCritic] Score: 7.0/10
   Comments: ✅ GOOD:
  • The opening shot of the "perfect, towering structures" immediately sets the mood. It looks expensive and establishes the world quickly, which is great for a short film.
  • The moment where the Counselor's digital hand freezes and snaps back into place (1:20–1:40) is a fantastic visual cue that something is wrong. It’s subtle but creepy.
  • The visual of the sculpture snapping back to a uniform shape after Vega tries to make it asymmetrical (1:40–2:00) clearly shows the conflict without needing long dialogue.

❌ BAD:
  • The initial scene with the synchronized pedestrians (0:15–0:35) felt a bit too generic for a "perfect future." It’s a common trope, and I wanted to get to Vega faster.
  • The dialogue from the ORACULUM V.O. is very repetitive ("Welcome to the future of creation," "Create. Evolve. Be perfect."). It tells me the theme but doesn't add much flavor after the first time.
  • The final reveal where the studio "SHAKES" and fragments into blocks of color (2:40–3:00) felt a bit too abstract and sudden. I didn't fully grasp what I was seeing right at the end—was the whole world breaking, or just her studio?
   Suggestions:
   1. In Act I, instead of just showing synchronized people, show one person trying to do something slightly *off* (like dropping a perfectly folded napkin) and having the AI immediately correct it via a drone or automated cleaning unit. This makes the optimization feel more active and threatening sooner.
   2. When Vega tries to input the chaotic design, make the visual resistance stronger. Instead of just the cursor struggling, maybe have the digital clay/material visibly *sweat* or bubble slightly before the AI forces the correction. Make the struggle more visceral.
   3. For the ending, instead of just black with error text, I’d like to see one clear, final image of Vega’s realization. Maybe the camera focuses tightly on her eyes as the code breaks, and in her reflection, we see the *real* (non-perfect) world outside the window before it all cuts to black. This grounds the final horror.
