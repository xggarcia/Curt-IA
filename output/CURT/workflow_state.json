  "script": "INTENTIONAL DELETION: The script is being revised to remove the \"subliminal FLASH of movement in the reflection\" and the unnatural \"HUM\" sound effect, per feedback, replacing them with more concrete visual cues and focused sound design.\n\n## THE LAST LINE (REVISION #13)\n\n**LOGLINE:** A writer, struggling with a blank page, finds unexpected resolution in a single, final sentence.\n\n**PAGE COUNT:** 1\n\n---\n\n**SCENE 1**\n\n**INT. DUSTY OFFICE - NIGHT**\n\nCLOSE ON: A vintage typewriter, keys gleaming under a harsh desk lamp. Dust motes dance in the light.\n\nSOUND of slow, rhythmic RAIN against the window.\n\nMARTHA (40s), intense eyes, hair pulled back haphazardly, stares at the typewriter carriage. The paper is stark white, save for three lines of text already typed.\n\n<center>MARTHA</center>\n> (Sharp, strained)\n> One more. Just one word.\n\nShe lifts her hands, types a single, terrible word: \"Never.\" She immediately backspaces it with a vicious *click-clack*, ripping the paper from the roller with a frustrated GRUNT. She crumples the sheet into a tight ball and throws it across the room. It hits a high shelf with a soft thud.\n\nShe feeds a fresh, clean sheet into the carriage.\n\n**CLOSE UP - TYPEWRITER PAPER**\n\nThe existing lines read:\n\n> *The silence in the house was deafening.*\n> *She waited for the sound of his key.*\n> *But the lock remained untouched.*\n\nMartha sighs, a small, tight puff of air. She reaches for a half-empty glass of water and takes a long, shaky gulp.\n\n**WIDE SHOT**\n\nThe office is cluttered, stacked high with books and discarded drafts. Martha looks trapped within the chaos.\n\nShe slams the glass down, splashing a few drops onto the desk blotter. The sharp sound cuts through the rain.\n\nFor a beat, the steady RAIN SOUND momentarily DIES, leaving an unnatural, heavy quiet.\n\nMartha glances instinctively toward the darkened doorway leading to the rest of the house, her eyes wide, searching the blackness just beyond the lamplight. Nothing moves.\n\nThe sound of the rain immediately returns, washing over the silence.\n\nDriven by a sudden, fierce spike of adrenaline, she grabs the clean sheet and slams her hands back onto the keys.\n\nSOUND of rapid, determined TYPING—a furious flurry of clacking keys.\n\nMartha pulls the carriage return with a sharp, final *DING!* She leans back slightly, breathing heavily, studying her work.\n\n**CLOSE UP - TYPEWRITER PAPER**\n\nThe final line is now complete, centered beneath the previous three.\n\n> *The silence in the house was deafening.*\n> *She waited for the sound of his key.*\n> *But the lock remained untouched.*\n> **He was already inside.**\n\nMartha leans forward, her relief immediate, but quickly curdling into a silent, deep-seated HORROR. Her mouth trembles slightly.\n\nShe reaches out a single finger to trace the final word: \"inside.\"\n\nThe moment her skin brushes the paper, her eyes lock onto the word, widening in pure dread. Her entire body goes rigid. She doesn't recoil in pain, but freezes in absolute, paralyzing realization.\n\nHer sharp, strangled INTAKE OF BREATH is the only sound louder than the rain.\n\n**FINAL SHOT**\n\nMartha pulls back from the typewriter, her body shaking violently. She presses her forehead against the cool metal frame, not in exhaustion, but in shock, trying to ground herself against the truth she just penned. Her hands shake uncontrollably as she clamps one hand over her mouth. The single sheet of paper sits under the harsh lamp, the story finished, the terror confirmed.\n\nFADE TO BLACK.\n\n**END SCENE**",
