**SCENE 1**

**INT. DUSTY OFFICE - NIGHT**

CLOSE ON: A vintage typewriter, keys gleaming under a harsh desk lamp. Dust motes dance in the light.

SOUND of slow, rhythmic RAIN against the window.

MARTHA (40s), intense eyes, hair pulled back haphazardly, stares at the typewriter carriage. The paper is stark white, save for three lines of text already typed.

<center>MARTHA</center>
> (A sharp whisper)
> Finished. Just one more.

She lifts her hands over the keys, hesitates, then drops them, defeated. She runs a hand over her tired face, rubbing her temples hard.

**CLOSE UP - TYPEWRITER PAPER**

The existing lines read:

> *The silence in the house was deafening.*
> *She waited for the sound of his key.*
> *But the lock remained untouched.*

Martha sighs, a small, defeated puff of air. She reaches for a half-empty glass of water on the desk.

**WIDE SHOT**

The office is cluttered, stacked high with books and discarded drafts. Martha looks trapped within the chaos.

She takes a slow sip of water, then slams the glass down, splashing a few drops. Frustration boils over.

She grabs a crumpled DRAFT BALL from the desk and hurls it across the room. It hits a bookshelf with a soft thud, bouncing away. She doesn't look where it landed.

A flicker of fierce resolve crosses her face. She slams her hands back onto the keys.

SOUND of rapid, determined TYPING—faster, more violent than before. A flurry of clacking keys.

Martha pulls the carriage return with a sharp, final *DING!* She leans back slightly, breathing heavily, studying her work.

She glances sharply toward the dark window, as if expecting to hear something over the rain, but hears only the steady drip.

**CLOSE UP - TYPEWRITER PAPER**

The final line is now complete, centered beneath the previous three.

> *The silence in the house was deafening.*
> *She waited for the sound of his key.*
> *But the lock remained untouched.*
> **He was already inside.**

Martha leans forward, her relief immediate, but quickly curdling into a silent, deep-seated HORROR. Her mouth trembles slightly.

She reaches out a single finger and gently traces the final word: "inside." Her eyes widen, the realization sinking in—the dread is justified.

**FINAL SHOT**

Martha rests her forehead against the cool metal frame of the typewriter. Her body goes rigid. The rain continues its steady rhythm outside, indifferent. The single sheet of paper sits under the harsh lamp, the story finally finished, the truth exposed.

FADE TO BLACK.
