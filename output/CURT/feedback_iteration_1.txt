AGGREGATED FEEDBACK:
=== TRIBUNAL VOTING RESULTS ===

STATUS: ✗ REJECTED

✓ [TechnicalCritic] Score: 9.0/10
   Comments: ✅ GOOD:
  • The script is extremely contained (single location, single character, minimal props), making it highly efficient and budget-friendly for production, regardless of whether traditional filming or advanced AI generation is used.
  • The visual focus on the **CLOSE UP - TYPEWRITER PAPER** is technically straightforward to capture or render, requiring precise focus pulling or high-detail rendering of text on paper.
  • The sound design elements (slow, rhythmic RAIN; sharp *DING!* of the carriage return; rapid TYPING) are distinct and easily achievable in post-production or through simple on-set sound effects.

❌ BAD:
  • The description of the **CLOSE ON: A vintage typewriter** requires sourcing or accurately modeling a specific period prop, which, while not impossible, adds a layer of prop department complexity compared to modern equipment.
  • The lighting description relies heavily on "harsh desk lamp," which, if not carefully managed during shooting or rendering, can lead to overly blown-out highlights or unnatural shadows, potentially obscuring the dust motes.
  • Continuity relies entirely on the precise visual state of the paper (three lines, then four lines). Any error in the visual representation of the text progression will break the narrative payoff.

✗ [NarrativeCritic] Score: 7.0/10
   Comments: ✅ GOOD:
  • **Visual Economy:** The script uses the single page format effectively, relying entirely on visual storytelling (the typewriter, the office clutter, Martha's exhaustion) to establish setting and mood without needing exposition.
  • **Strong Final Beat:** The final line, "He was already inside," delivers a powerful, unexpected narrative twist that recontextualizes the preceding lines, providing the "unexpected resolution" promised in the logline.
  • **Clear Character Motivation:** Martha's motivation—the need to finish the story—is immediately clear through her intense focus and visible struggle with the blank page.

❌ BAD:
  • **Lack of Context for the Struggle:** While we see Martha struggling, the script doesn't give the audience enough visual or implied context for *why* this specific sentence is so difficult. Is it writer's block, or is the content itself emotionally draining? The struggle feels abstract.
  • **Underdeveloped Emotional Arc:** The transition from "defeated" (after sipping water) to "rapid, determined TYPING" is too abrupt for such a short piece. We miss the crucial moment of breakthrough or realization.
  • **Dialogue Redundancy:** Martha's line, "Come on," is functional but adds little beyond confirming she is struggling, which the visuals already convey perfectly.
   Suggestions:
   1. **Heighten the Physicality of the Struggle:** Instead of just muttering "Come on," give Martha a specific physical action related to the *content* she is blocked on. Perhaps she types and immediately backspaces violently, or she physically recoils from the existing three lines before trying again. This connects the block to the story she is writing.
   2. **Refine the Breakthrough Moment:** Before the "rapid, determined TYPING," insert a beat where Martha looks at something *off-screen* or focuses intensely on a specific object in the cluttered room (a photograph, a specific book) that triggers the final thought. This externalizes the internal shift.
   3. **SUGGEST REMOVAL:** Remove the dialogue "Come on." The visual of her staring at the page and dropping her hands already communicates the frustration far more powerfully than a single, generic line of dialogue. Replace the space with a stronger visual beat showing her internal conflict.

✗ [AudienceCritic] Score: 6.0/10
   Comments: ✅ GOOD:
  • The visual setup is strong; the "vintage typewriter," "dusty office," and "harsh desk lamp" immediately set a moody, focused atmosphere that suggests serious work or obsession.
  • The existing three lines of text build effective, simple tension. The audience immediately understands the character is waiting for someone who isn't arriving.
  • The final line, "He was already inside," is a great punchline/twist for a short piece. It shifts the meaning of the preceding lines completely and is memorable.

❌ BAD:
  • The script is *too* short and lacks any real narrative movement beyond Martha staring at the machine. It feels more like a short poem than a film scene.
  • Martha's emotional state is described as "intense" and "tired," but we don't see *why* she’s so trapped. The clutter is mentioned, but we don't see her interact with it, making her struggle feel abstract.
  • The transition from defeat (dropping hands, sipping water) to rapid typing feels too sudden. It’s a big emotional shift in a very short time frame, making the resolution feel unearned.
   Suggestions:
   1. Show the *cost* of the blank page. Instead of just Martha sighing, maybe she crumples up a piece of paper and throws it violently (but misses the trash can), showing the frustration before the final breakthrough.
   2. Add a brief, non-verbal moment *after* the typing flurry where Martha looks toward the door or a window, perhaps hearing a sound that *isn't* the key, reinforcing the dread before she sees the final sentence. This raises the stakes before the reveal.
   3. When she touches the final word, "inside," we need a stronger reaction than "unreadable." Since the twist is so dark, maybe her relief is immediately replaced by horror, or she smiles—but we need to see *which* emotion wins out so the audience knows how to interpret the ending (Is she relieved he’s home, or terrified he’s already there?).
