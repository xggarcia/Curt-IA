## THE LAST LINE

**LOGLINE:** A writer, struggling with a blank page, finds unexpected resolution in a single, final sentence.

**PAGE COUNT:** 1

**SCENE 1**

**INT. DUSTY OFFICE - NIGHT**

CLOSE ON: A vintage typewriter, keys gleaming under a harsh desk lamp. Dust motes dance in the light.

SOUND of slow, rhythmic RAIN against the window.

MARTHA (40s), intense eyes, hair pulled back haphazardly, stares at the typewriter carriage. The paper is stark white, save for three lines of text already typed.

<center>MARTHA</center>
> (Muttering to herself)
> Come on.

She lifts her hands over the keys, hesitates, then drops them, defeated. She runs a hand over her tired face.

**CLOSE UP - TYPEWRITER PAPER**

The existing lines read:

> *The silence in the house was deafening.*
> *She waited for the sound of his key.*
> *But the lock remained untouched.*

Martha sighs, a small, defeated puff of air. She reaches for a half-empty glass of water on the desk.

**WIDE SHOT**

The office is cluttered, stacked high with books and discarded drafts. Martha looks trapped within the chaos.

She takes a slow sip of water, her eyes drifting back to the machine. A flicker of resolve crosses her face.

She slams her hands back onto the keys.

SOUND of rapid, determined TYPING. A flurry of clacking keys.

Martha pulls the carriage return with a sharp *DING!* She leans back slightly, studying her work.

**CLOSE UP - TYPEWRITER PAPER**

The final line is now complete, centered beneath the previous three.

> *The silence in the house was deafening.*
> *She waited for the sound of his key.*
> *But the lock remained untouched.*
> **He was already inside.**

Martha leans forward, her expression unreadable—a mixture of relief and profound sadness.

She slowly reaches out a finger and gently touches the final word: "inside."

**FINAL SHOT**

Martha rests her forehead against the cool metal frame of the typewriter. The rain continues its steady rhythm outside. The single sheet of paper sits under the harsh lamp, the story finally finished.

FADE TO BLACK.
