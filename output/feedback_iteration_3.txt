=== TRIBUNAL VOTING RESULTS ===

STATUS: ✗ REJECTED

✓ [TechnicalCritic] Score: 8.0/10
   Comments: Strengths: The scene descriptions are highly visual and the action is relatively contained, making it excellent for AI generation. The focus on close-ups (water line, Percy's face) provides strong emotional beats that AI can render effectively. The core concept (cat vs. fishbowl) is simple and repeatable. The lighting (sunlight streaming) is a straightforward, achievable environmental effect.

✗ [AudienceCritic] Score: 5.0/10
   Comments: What I Liked: This was surprisingly charming! I liked the focus on the cat, Percy. The idea of a cat having this intense, silent mission was funny. The action sequences—the silent leap, the paw testing the water—were engaging. It’s a simple concept, but it held my attention for the whole three minutes. The ending, where the cat gives up and actually *pushes the bowl back*, was a great little twist.
What Confused Me: I was confused by the "bead of sweat (or condensation?) on his forehead." That felt a little too cartoonish for the otherwise realistic, focused tone. Also, the spoon part was a bit silly—I didn't really buy that a cat could *leverage* a heavy bowl with a spoon, but I guess it served the plot.
Did It Deliver: Since the genre is "unspecified," I'd say it delivered a really solid, short **Animal Comedy/Heist** vibe. It delivered on the promise of watching a determined animal try to achieve a goal. It was light, fun, and didn't promise anything it couldn't deliver.
Memorable Moments: The moment Percy dips his paw in, pulls out just one droplet, and it falls back with a pathetic *plink* was hilarious. Also, the final look between the cat and the fish before the cat walks away with dignity.
   Suggestions:
   1. Since it’s so short, maybe lean harder into the comedy or the tension. If the cat was slightly more clumsy (knocking something over accidentally), it might have been funnier. But honestly, for a three-minute watch, it was pretty solid entertainment.

VERDICT: Revisions needed (avg score: 6.0/10)
