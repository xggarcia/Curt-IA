## THE WAITING GAME

**LOG LINE:** A sleek house cat stalks a goldfish in a sunlit living room, the quiet tension building to an inevitable, yet strangely peaceful, conclusion.

**TARGET DURATION:** ~180 Seconds

---

**SCENE 1**

**INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY (0:00 - 0:30)**

Bright, warm sunlight streams through sheer curtains, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The room is minimalist, expensive.

CLOSE ON: A large, pristine GLASS FISHBOWL resting on a polished mahogany end table. Inside, a single, vibrant ORANGE GOLDFISH swims slow, lazy circles.

We hear the faint, rhythmic HUM of a refrigerator from another room.

A shadow falls across the glass.

WIDE SHOT: MARMALADE (a large, glossy ginger tabby cat) is crouched low on the carpet beside the table. His body is coiled, muscles taut. His eyes, wide and green, are locked onto the fish. He is utterly still.

Marmalade twitches his tail tip once.

**SCENE 2**

**INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER (0:30 - 1:15)**

CLOSE ON: The goldfish, oblivious, nudges a plastic plant.

Marmalade slowly lifts one massive, white-socked paw. He extends a single, needle-sharp CLAW, testing the air.

He brings the paw closer to the water's surface. A tiny ripple disturbs the reflection of the ceiling light.

The goldfish darts away, then stops, hovering just out of reach.

Marmalade lowers his head, sniffing the glass, a low, guttural CHUFF escaping his throat. He doesn't blink.

**SCENE 3**

**INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (1:15 - 2:15)**

Marmalade shifts his weight, preparing for a leap that would certainly shatter the bowl. He gathers his haunches.

SOUND: A distant, high-pitched BEEPING begins—a microwave timer finishing.

Marmalade FREEZES. His focus breaks, just for a millisecond. His ears swivel toward the sound.

The goldfish uses the fractional hesitation. It swims directly to the side of the bowl opposite the cat, hovering near the glass, almost looking *at* Marmalade.

Marmalade turns his head back, annoyed by the interruption, but the moment of kinetic energy is gone. He settles back onto his haunches.

He lets out a long, theatrical SIGH—a puff of air that barely moves his whiskers.

**SCENE 4**

**INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER (2:15 - 3:00)**

The sunlight has shifted, casting long shadows.

Marmalade is no longer stalking. He is draped across the end table, his head resting near the base of the fishbowl. He is half-asleep, but one eye remains cracked open, lazily observing.

The goldfish swims up to the glass directly in front of the cat's nose. It circles slowly, its fins barely moving.

Marmalade gently taps the glass with a closed, soft paw—not striking, just *touching*. A light, almost affectionate connection.

The goldfish bumps the glass back, a tiny, almost imperceptible pressure against the cat's paw pad.

Marmalade closes his good eye completely. He is no longer hunting. He is simply resting beside his companion.

FADE TO BLACK.
