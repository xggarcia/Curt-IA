## THE CATCH

**LOGLINE:** A determined housecat attempts to liberate a prize fish from a precarious perch.

**DURATION:** Approximately 3 Minutes

**SCENE 1**

**INT. KITCHEN - DAY**

Sunlight streams across a pristine, modern kitchen. Everything is orderly, except for one spot: the counter.

A large, ornate CERAMIC FISH BOWL sits near the edge of the counter. Inside, a magnificent, iridescent GOLDFISH swims lazily.

PERCY (O.S.)
(A low, guttural rumble)

A sleek, black CAT, PERCY, crouches low on the polished hardwood floor, eyes locked on the bowl. He is utterly focused.

Percy takes a tentative, silent step forward. His tail twitches once.

**CLOSE ON: THE WATER LINE**

The water ripples slightly as the Goldfish drifts close to the glass, seemingly unaware of the impending danger.

Percy springs, a controlled, powerful leap. He lands silently on the counter, inches from the bowl.

**SCENE 2**

**INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS**

Percy peers over the rim of the bowl. His reflection distorts the water's surface.

He carefully extends one paw, claws sheathed, testing the air above the water.

The Goldfish, startled by the shadow, darts to the far side of the bowl.

Percy retracts the paw, annoyed. He tries a different approach: stretching his neck, trying to reach the center from the side.

He strains, his whiskers brushing the ceramic edge. He is inches short.

**CLOSE ON: PERCY'S FACE**

A bead of sweat (or condensation?) forms on his forehead. Frustration mounts.

Percy looks around the kitchen wildly, searching for leverage. His eyes land on a nearby object: a SILVER SPOON, left carelessly near the sink.

**SCENE 3**

**INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS**

Percy jumps down, landing again without a sound. He nudges the spoon with his nose. It’s too large to carry.

He returns to the counter, jumping up again. He uses both front paws to grip the spoon handle, pulling it toward the fishbowl.

The spoon scrapes loudly against the granite counter.

**SOUND:** *SCRRRRRAPE*

The Goldfish freezes mid-swim.

Percy manages to leverage the bowl slightly, tilting it toward him just enough.

**CLOSE ON: THE WATER**

The water level shifts dangerously toward the counter edge.

Percy dips his paw into the water—a quick, surgical strike.

He pulls his paw out immediately. Dangling from one claw is a single, shimmering DROPLET of water.

He shakes his paw, trying to catch the water, but it falls back to the counter with a tiny, pathetic *plink*.

The Goldfish, seizing the opportunity, swims directly underneath the suspended paw.

**SCENE 4**

**INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS**

Percy stares at his empty paw, defeated. He looks at the Goldfish, which is now swimming confidently near the surface again, almost mocking him.

Percy lowers his head, resting his chin on the cool ceramic edge. He closes his eyes, letting out a long, silent sigh.

**WIDE SHOT**

The cat, defeated, resting against the bowl, bathed in the afternoon sun.

After a moment, Percy opens one eye. He looks at the Goldfish. The Goldfish looks back.

Percy slowly, deliberately, pushes the ceramic bowl back toward the center of the counter, away from the edge.

He hops down, turns, and walks toward the kitchen doorway with slow, dignified steps.

**CLOSE ON: THE FISHBOWL**

The Goldfish swims a triumphant, wide circle.

**FADE TO BLACK.**
