## THE MARGIN NOTE (Revised)

**LOGLINE:** A perfectionist proofreader finds a single, unauthorized word scrawled in the margin of a manuscript, shattering his meticulous world.

**SCENE 1**

**INT. ARCHIVE OFFICE - NIGHT**

SOUND of the soft, rhythmic CLICK of a mechanical keyboard

The room is sterile, bathed in the cold, focused glow of a single DESK LAMP. Dust motes hang suspended in the light beam.

ARTHUR (50s), precise, glasses perfectly aligned, sits before a massive, bound MANUSCRIPT. His posture is rigid, a monument to order.

CLOSE ON: Arthur’s hand, gripping a sharp, bright RED PEN. He traces a line of dense academic text.

He is proofreading. Every detail is accounted for.

He moves down the page. Perfection.

Arthur taps the red pen against his lower lip, a small, satisfied motion. He reaches the bottom corner.

CLOSE ON: The margin. A single, jarringly messy, black ink word is scrawled there.

The word: **"WHY?"**

Arthur freezes. The keyboard CLICK STOPS. Silence rushes in, heavy and absolute.

His gaze snaps to the preceding line—dry, historical prose.

Arthur lifts the red pen, hovering just above the offending mark. His training screams: *Correct it.*

He lowers the pen, stopping millimeters from the paper. He cannot touch it.

He leans in, face inches from the manuscript, his reflection distorted slightly on the aged paper. He stares at the single, defiant question.

Arthur deliberately places the red pen down. It rolls slightly, threatening the neat stack of corrected drafts.

He reaches into his breast pocket and extracts a slender, silver FOUNTAIN PEN. It looks ancient, personal.

He uncaps it. The nib gleams.

CLOSE ON: Arthur’s hand, moving with agonizing slowness.

Instead of striking out the question, he writes one word directly beneath it, in elegant, almost calligraphic script.

**ARTHUR (V.O.)**
(A breathy whisper)
Because.

Arthur leans back. The rigidity leaves his frame. A profound, unsettling calm washes over his features. He allows a faint, almost imperceptible SMILE.

He looks up, past the lamp, into the shadowed corners of the vast, silent office.

He reaches out and gently closes the heavy manuscript. The sound is a soft, final THUD.

**FADE TO BLACK.**
