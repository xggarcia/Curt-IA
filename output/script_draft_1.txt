## THE HUNGER

**LOG LINE:** A determined house cat executes a stealth mission to claim a prize: a goldfish swimming placidly in a bowl.

**DURATION:** Approx. 3 Minutes

---

**FADE IN:**

**INT. KITCHEN - DAY**

Sunlight slices through the window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The room is otherwise quiet, modern, and meticulously clean.

On a sleek wooden counter sits a large, pristine GLASS FISH BOWL. Inside, FINN (a vibrant orange GOLDFISH) drifts lazily near the plastic castle centerpiece.

CLOSE ON: A pair of intense, emerald EYES.

They belong to LEO (a sleek, black HOUSE CAT). Leo is crouched low on the kitchen floor, belly almost scraping the tile. He is a coiled spring.

Leo’s tail twitches once, a tiny vibration of pure focus.

**ACTION**
Leo takes one agonizingly slow, silent step forward. His paws barely disturb the polished floor.

He stops, listening. The only sound is the gentle WHIR of the refrigerator.

**INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS**

Leo assesses the distance to the counter edge. Too high for a direct leap.

He shifts his gaze. He spies a stack of old COOKBOOKS leaning precariously against a low cabinet beside him.

Leo approaches the cookbooks. He uses a paw, gingerly nudging the bottom book.

The stack SHIVERS.

Leo freezes, holding his breath.

Finn, oblivious, swims a slow circle in his bowl.

Leo nudges the book again, harder this time. The stack begins to lean outward, towards the counter.

**ACTION**
Leo pushes with his shoulder, applying controlled pressure.

The cookbooks give way with a soft THUD, forming a makeshift, wobbly staircase leading up the side of the cabinet.

Leo leaps onto the first book. It dips alarmingly. He uses the momentum to spring onto the cabinet top.

He is now level with the counter, two feet away from the prize.

**CLOSE ON - LEO’S FACE**
His pupils are fully dilated, black voids reflecting the bowl’s water. He is inches from glory.

He inches toward the bowl. His whiskers brush the cool granite countertop.

He stops just short of the glass. He leans in, his breath fogging a tiny patch of the glass.

Finn darts suddenly, perhaps sensing the shadow.

Leo reacts instantly. He doesn't try to grab. He uses his paw to *tap* the glass sharply, right where Finn just was.

The water RIPPLES violently. Finn rockets to the opposite side of the bowl.

Leo pulls his paw back, annoyed by the lack of immediate success.

He positions himself directly over the bowl. He slowly extends one front paw over the water’s surface. It hovers, a black shadow above the shimmering surface.

**CLOSE ON - THE WATER**
The paw descends slowly, breaking the tension of the surface. Ripples expand outward.

Leo dips his claws just beneath the surface, aiming for the bottom.

**SOUND:** A sharp, high-pitched BEEP.

Leo retracts his paw as if scalded, shaking it violently.

**INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS**

The microwave timer BEEPS insistently, signaling something is done.

Leo glares toward the source of the noise—the microwave, which is flashing "00:00."

**ACTION**
A pair of human HANDS (unseen) enter the frame, opening the microwave door. A cloud of steam billows out.

The hands retrieve a plate of something savory—perhaps bacon.

Leo’s attention is instantly diverted. The smell is overwhelming.

He looks from the bacon to the fish bowl. The fish is still there, safe.

Leo makes his decision.

He turns and trots away from the counter, heading toward the scent of bacon.

**WIDE SHOT**
Leo sits patiently beside the human’s chair, looking up with an expression of practiced, pathetic need.

The human places a strip of bacon on the floor near Leo.

Leo snatches it instantly and begins chewing contentedly.

**CLOSE ON - THE FISH BOWL**
Finn, having recovered from the tapping, slowly swims back toward the center of the bowl. He nudges the plastic castle, seemingly unfazed by the near-death experience.

The sunlight catches his scales. He is safe, for now.

**FADE OUT.**
