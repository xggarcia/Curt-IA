## THE MARGIN NOTE

**LOGLINE:** A perfectionist proofreader finds a single, unauthorized word scrawled in the margin of a manuscript, shattering his meticulous world.

**SCENE 1**

**INT. ARCHIVE OFFICE - NIGHT**

SOUND of the soft, rhythmic CLICK of a mechanical keyboard

The room is sterile, lit by a single, harsh DESK LAMP. Dust motes dance in the light.

ARTHUR (50s), impeccably dressed, thin glasses perched on his nose, sits before a massive, bound MANUSCRIPT. He is the picture of meticulous control.

CLOSE ON: Arthur’s hand, holding a bright red pen. He traces a line of text, his brow furrowed in concentration.

He is proofreading an academic paper. Every comma, every citation, is under his microscopic scrutiny.

He moves down the page. Everything is perfect.

Arthur taps the red pen against his lower lip, satisfied. He reaches the bottom corner of the page.

CLOSE ON: The margin. A single, messy, black ink word is scrawled there, clearly not part of the official text.

The word: **"WHY?"**

Arthur freezes. His breathing hitches.

His eyes dart to the preceding line of text—a dry, dense sentence about 18th-century agricultural yields.

Arthur lifts his hand, the red pen trembling slightly above the offending mark. He hesitates. His entire professional existence demands he strike it out, flag it, report it.

He lowers the pen, stopping just short of the paper.

He leans in, his face inches from the manuscript, staring intensely at the single, defiant word.

Arthur slowly, deliberately, puts the red pen down on the desk.

He reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls out a small, silver fountain pen—a tool he hasn't used professionally in years. It’s clearly personal.

He uncaps it. The nib catches the lamplight.

CLOSE ON: Arthur’s hand, moving slowly, shakily.

Instead of crossing out "WHY?", he carefully, almost reverently, writes a single word beneath it, in his own fine script.

**ARTHUR (V.O.)**
(Whispered, almost to himself)
Because.

Arthur leans back in his chair. The tension drains from his shoulders, replaced by a profound, unsettling calm.

He looks around the silent office, as if seeing it—and himself—for the first time.

He reaches out and gently closes the heavy manuscript.

**FADE TO BLACK.**
