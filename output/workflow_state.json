    "genre": "Psychological Drama / Contained Thriller",
    "tone": "Tense, claustrophobic, intellectually combative, with underlying notes of desperation and disillusionment.",
    "pacing": "Slow, deliberate build-up punctuated by sharp, rapid-fire verbal volleys. Dominated by long takes focused on dialogue and subtle non-verbal reactions, creating a sense of mounting pressure.",

  "script": "## THE MARGIN NOTE (Revised)\n\n**LOGLINE:** A perfectionist proofreader finds a single, unauthorized word scrawled in the margin of a manuscript, shattering his meticulous world.\n\n**SCENE 1**\n\n**INT. ARCHIVE OFFICE - NIGHT**\n\nSOUND of the soft, rhythmic CLICK of a mechanical keyboard.\n\nThe room is sterile, lit by the cold, focused glow of a single DESK LAMP.\n\nARTHUR (50s), immaculate, sits before a massive, bound MANUSCRIPT. His posture is rigid.\n\nCLOSE ON: Arthur’s hand, gripping a sharp, bright RED PEN. He traces a line of dense academic text. Perfection.\n\nHe moves down the page. He reaches the bottom corner.\n\nCLOSE ON: The margin. A single, jarringly messy, black ink word is scrawled there.\n\nThe word: **\"WHY?\"**\n\nArthur freezes. The keyboard CLICK STOPS. Silence.\n\nHis gaze snaps to the preceding line—dry, historical prose.\n\nArthur lifts the red pen, hovering just above the offending mark. He cannot touch it.\n\nHe leans in, face inches from the paper, staring at the defiant question.\n\nArthur deliberately places the red pen down.\n\nHe reaches into his breast pocket and extracts a slender, silver FOUNTAIN PEN.\n\nHe uncaps it.\n\nCLOSE ON: Arthur’s hand, moving with agonizing slowness.\n\nInstead of striking out the question, he writes one word directly beneath it, in elegant script.\n\n**ARTHUR (V.O.)**\n(A breathy whisper)\nBecause.\n\nArthur leans back. The rigidity leaves his frame. A profound, unsettling calm washes over his features. A faint, almost imperceptible SMILE.\n\nHe reaches out and gently closes the heavy manuscript. The sound is a soft, final THUD.\n\n**FADE TO BLACK.**\n\n**END SCENE**",
