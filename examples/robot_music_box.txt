INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

A small MAINTENANCE ROBOT (Model R-7) rolls through dusty corridors, its single optical sensor scanning the debris-strewn floor.

The robot stops. Its sensor focuses on something half-buried under rubble.

CLOSE ON - A tarnished MUSIC BOX, ornate and antique.

R-7's mechanical arm extends, carefully extracting the music box from the debris.

The robot's sensors analyze the object. A beat. Then, almost hesitantly, R-7 winds the small key on the box's side.

The music box opens. A delicate MELODY begins to play - a haunting lullaby that fills the empty warehouse.

R-7's optical sensor brightens and dims in rhythm with the music, as if... mesmerized.

The robot's movements become gentle, almost dance-like, swaying slightly as the melody continues.

FLASHBACK IMAGES (Brief, fragmented):
- Human hands winding the same music box
- A child's laughter
- Warm lights in a home

BACK TO PRESENT

The melody slows... stops.

R-7 sits motionless for a long moment. Then, with what can only be described as tenderness, the robot rewinds the music box.

The melody plays again.

R-7's optical sensor glows a softer blue - a color it has never displayed before.

For the first time in its existence, R-7 understands something beyond its programming.

It understands beauty. Memory. Loss.

And perhaps... emotion.

FADE OUT.
